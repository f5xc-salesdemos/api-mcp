This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting significant design
decisions made in the F5 XC API MCP Server project.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records document the key architectural decisions made throughout a project's lifecycle, including:

- The context and problem being addressed
- The decision that was made
- The consequences of that decision
- Alternative options that were considered
