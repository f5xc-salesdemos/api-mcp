# Trivy Vulnerability Ignore File
# Temporary exclusions for vulnerabilities in npm bundled dependencies
#
# These vulnerabilities are in packages bundled with npm (node:24-alpine base image),
# not in our application dependencies. Package.json overrides do not affect npm's
# bundled dependencies.
#
# Remediation Strategy:
# - Monitor node:24-alpine releases for npm updates with fixed versions
# - Remove these ignores once upstream provides fixed npm version
# - Review monthly until resolved
#
